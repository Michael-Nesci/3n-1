**3n + 1 Graph Display**

This is a simple HTML file that displays results of the 3n+1/Collatz Conjecture. Enter a number into the box, and the graph will be created!


*The Collatz Conjecture*

Also known as the 3n+1 problem, the Collatz Conjecture goes as follows:

Given any positive real number n:
- If n is odd, multiply it by 3 then add 1 (3n+1)
- If n is even, divide it by 2 (n/2)

And repeat the process.

Eventually, the number will reach 1. The graph stops here, else the program will loop infinitely (1*3+1 = 4 -> 4/2 = 2 -> 2/2 = 1 -> repeat).

Despite being a fairly simple conjecture, the 3n+1 problem has not been proven, nor has a counterexample been found since its introduction in 1937.


**Note:** This program isn't meant to brute-force/prove the conjecture, I just think graphs are fun :}
